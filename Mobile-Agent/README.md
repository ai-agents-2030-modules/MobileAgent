# üåøü™ë [SPA-Bench](https://github.com/ai-agents-2030/SPA-Bench) ‚Äì Major Adaptation for [MobileAgent](https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent) üîß

- Logs of agent-executed trajectories (screenshots, actions, errors, token costs, number of steps).
- Support for open-source models as replacements for GPT-based models.
- Use cached local models.

## üìãIntroduction
![](assets/example.png?v=1&type=image)
* Pure visual solution, independent of XML and system metadata.
* Unrestricted operation scope, capable of multi-app operations.
* Multiple visual perception tools for operation localization.
* No need for exploration and training, plug and play.

## üì¢News
* [3.10]üî•üî•Mobile-Agent has been accepted by the **ICLR 2024 Workshop on Large Language Model (LLM) Agents**.
* [3.4]üî•üî•We provide [Mobile-Agent via Qwen-vl-max](https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent/blob/main/MobileAgent-qwen/README.md). Qwen-vl-max is a free multi-modal large language model.
* [2.21] We provide a demo that can upload screenshots from mobile devices. Now you can experience it at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/junyangwang0410/Mobile-Agent) and [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/studios/wangjunyang/Mobile-Agent/summary).
*  [2.5] We provide a **free** API and deploy the entire process for experiencing Mobile Agent, even if **you don't have an OpenAI API Key**. Check out [Quick Start](#quick_start).

### Hugging Face Demo
![](assets/huggingface_demo.png?v=1&type=image)
The demo can now be experienced at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/junyangwang0410/Mobile-Agent) and [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/studios/wangjunyang/Mobile-Agent/summary).

## üîßPreparation

‚ùóAt present, only **Android OS** and **Harmony OS** (version <= 4) support tool debugging. Other systems, such as **iOS**, do not support the use of Mobile-Agent for the time being.

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent.git
cd MobileAgent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Preparation for Connecting Mobile Device
1. Download the [Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools?hl=en).
2. Turn on the ADB debugging switch on your Android phone, it needs to be turned on in the developer options first.
3. Connect your phone to the computer with a data cable and select "Transfer files".
4. Test your ADB environment as follow: ```/path/to/adb devices```. If the connected devices are displayed, the preparation is complete.
5. If you are using a MAC or Linux system, make sure to turn on adb permissions as follow: ```sudo chmod +x /path/to/adb```
6. If you are using Windows system, the path will be ```xx/xx/adb.exe```

## üîßQuick Start
### Note
‚ùóSince the GPT-4V will have severe hallucinations when perceiving non-English screenshots, we strongly recommend using Mobile-Agent under English-only systems and apps to ensure the performance.

‚ùóDue to current limited resources, please contact us to get a free API Key consisting of a **url** and a **token**.

* Email: junyangwang@bjtu.edu.cn, junyangwang287@gmail.com(If the former cannot be reached)
* WeChat: Wangjunyang0410

### Run
```
python run_api.py --adb_path /path/to/adb --url "The url you got" --token "The token you got" --instruction "your instruction"
```

## üîßGetting Started with your own API Key

```
python run.py --grounding_ckpt /path/to/GroundingDION --adb_path /path/to/adb --api "your API_TOKEN" --instruction "your instruction"
```
API_TOKEN is an API Key from OpenAI with the permission to access ```gpt-4-vision-preview```.

## üì±Mobile-Eval
Mobile-Eval is a benchmark designed for evaluating the performance of mobile device agents. This benchmark includes 10 mainstream single-app scenarios and 1 multi-app scenario. 

For each scenario, we have designed three instructions:
* Instruction 1: relatively simple and basic task
* Instruction 2: additional requirements added on top of the difficulty of Instruction 1
* Instruction 3: user demands with no explicit task indication

The detailed content of Mobile-Eval is as follows:
| Application   | Instruction   |
|-------|-------|
| Alibaba.com   | 1. Help me find caps in Alibaba.com.<br>2. Help me find caps in Alibaba.com. If the "Add to cart" is available in the item information page, please add the item to my cart.<br>3. I want to buy a cap. I've heard things are cheap on Alibaba.com. Maybe you can find it for me. |
| Amazon Music   | 1. Search singer Jay Chou in Amazon Music.<br>2. Search a music about "agent" in Amazon Music and play it.<br>3. I want to listen music to relax. Find an App to help me. |
| Chrome   | 1. Search result for today's Lakers game.<br>2. Search the information about Taylor Swift.<br>3. I want to know the result for today's Lakers game. Find an App to help me. |
| Gmail   | 1. Send an empty email to to {address}.<br>2. Send an email to {address}n to tell my new work.<br>3. I want to let my friend know my new work, and his address is {address}. Find an App to help me. |
| Google Maps   | 1. Navigate to Hangzhou West Lake.<br>2. Navigate to a nearby gas station.<br>3. I want to go to Hangzhou West Lake, but I don't know the way. Find an App to help me. |
| Google Play   | 1. Download WhatsApp in Play Store.<br>2. Download Instagram in Play Store.<br>3. I want WhatsApp on my phone. Find an App to help me. |
| Notes   | 1. Create a new note in Notes.<br>2. Create a new note in Notes and write "Hello, this is a note", then save it.<br>3. I suddenly have something to record, so help me find an App and write down the following content: meeting at 3pm. |
| Settings   | 1. Turn on the dark mode.<br>2. Turn on the airplane mode.<br>3. I want to see the real time internet speed at the battery level, please turn on this setting for me. |
